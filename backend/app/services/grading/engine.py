"""Mode A grading engine — port of TGFWA src/lib/grading/engine.ts.

Methodology (TGFWA spec §5): one criterion per LLM call (halo prevention),
both channels (product = essay, trace = dialogue), 3 sequential passes per
criterion with one retry each, evidence-provenance guard on every pass,
median + spread aggregation, concurrency 6 across criterion×channel jobs.

The LLM is injected as a callable `llm_json(system, prompt) -> dict` so tests
can drive the engine with a FakeLLM and the API layer wires in the configured
provider (core.llm.llm_chat_json + _extract_json).
